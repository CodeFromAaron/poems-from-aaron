If love is abundant,
   do you need to analyse 
        every crack in the concrete 
                                      to identify it. 

No need to search and search.
My findings are clear, concise, unconditional appreciation exists.

No need to give and give,
it's always been enough: 

       - no matter how grand the gesture
       - no matter how small the word

And so,

     Can you keep loving? 
                 Loving directionaless-ly.

Indiscriminate of where 
                     |_    love fell

        I sweat in my sleep 
   when I dream of you.

You're perforating from my skin,
I'm sheading the connections.

If I could stop it I would, 
because there was an impermanence 
to us that even my brain will one day 
be unable to overcome.

I feel lucky to have lived 
these moments with you, 

     then again in your absence while I sleep, 

and, once more, 

before they exit through my skin. 

Good morning, I have loved you, 
and it’s time for me to shower 
and enter today.

I’m going to be gone. On the other side of the screen.

It’s not comfortable, but it’s where I should be.
My personhood is intact but flickering. 

The channel is changing, and i’m tired of the person I was/am.
My ‘eepy sighs anticipate the airing of a new series.
I’m sorry I can't stay and watch or talk, but maybe one day 
we’ll see one another through the static.

Changed, new, and at ease

-----------------------

There used to be a big mound of dirt here.

We used to break into the construction site
  and drink, and dance.

There was a big mountain of dirt 
covered in a tarp, taller than the fences 
and the trees that blocked the sky. 

If you climbed to the top you could see
See the sunset over the city. It wasn't legal,
But you could also see the bats migrate
From the trees to the open air. Was pretty
Sick.

The concrete foundations would flood,
Forcing the dirt and dust to compound into 
a small muddy pond. The ibises would 
peck at the water while perched on a 
plastic office chair left right at the centre.

A mound of dirt felt like it had more 
character na the concrete left in its 
place. A dirt mound is cooler than a park
in my mind.

trawled out at sea,

He's really cute, with curly hair,
and he always sticks his tongue out in photos
because he doesn't know what to do with himself.

There's something satisfying about knowing
he doesn't know. It's like I get to admire a new
friend on a prospective level. You know?

Each new item I learn makes me want to know more.
It's not a hyper fixation, I can halt the thought.
But when we get a chance to talk it's fun and 
I want more.

I'm not digging for any fools gold.
This time I can let it be, knowing that
I got

--------------------------

I'm learning to let go of control.
All be it for the past four years I still manage to 
  latch on to whatever I can, tightly.

With knots in my shoulders that resemble calluses
  made up of stringent muscle.
It represents my harsh feelings towards circumstance.
I won't let it go, even though its well with in
my capabilities. I think my nature is persistent.

I like that part of me. 
I like how each arm claps around the ones I love.
Till the knots and pressure produce warmth.

Though I want to persist I risk creating heat
and pressure. Causing rope burn on their back.

I'm learning to let go of control,
  I'm learning to let go.

        content: `
-------------------------------

On my walk home I stopped and crouched.
Then I slid down into my legs and buried my face.

I chose to speak to myself plainly. 
I uttered what I had said when I was 16, 
walking home from school heart broken because
the boy I liked choose some else over me.
Even though they liked me back, they choose someone else.

  I said "I'm going to be alone for a long time, aren’t I?" 


Now, this isn’t wrong. But now saying it at twenty two.
It feels like a declaration of my patience.

  Instead of a rebuke of love or my emotions.

Rather an acknowledgement that these things take time.
Love takes time. It took time to love myself.
It took time for me to love people 
  and for them to love me back.
  Sometimes, that time never came back.

Like some check-mate to my existential dread
that I would be alone till it felt eternal.

  Hahaha, I won the argument before it could begin.

I will be alone for a while, I have been alone for while.
In love I feel often times alone, because I am
  yet to reach a point of terminal 
                                  velocity. 

I cant imagine the speed picking up anytime soon,
and I cant imagine it slowing down.

Today, at 2am. I now travel at a steady pace home.

Tomorrow I will shower, wash my hair, make my bed
  and shave my beard. 

Tomorrow I will wake up and wash away the sweat
from my red and dry skin. I will scrub away the smell.

The smell of a people will be gone, the memory
wiped away. It is a clean slate, the thermostat 
at a comfortable degree while I dry.

The version of myself that betrayed me, and my comfort
wont be there anymore. 

  There will be no facial hair.

  Because then I will be clean. 

This body is mine again, I reclaimed it this morning. 
A honest attempt at a self apology. 

When I smile the attention is not at the jaw, outlined 
by stubble and scruff. But the soft slope from my face 
  to the nape of my neck.

  Because, I am clean. 

I can fold new sheets, make my bed. Lay and smile.
Because I am more than the wretched smelling seams.

The changes I have made, that added with the notes
I have written. Will set me up for a clean slated day.

I love myself 
before the bath,
       during,
           and after.

-----------------------------------------

I blinked twice, drafted a message in my head.
It would read:

  > Dude I miss you, I wish you'd talk to me
    sent 4:18pm

Day dreaming about if it had continued. 
Locking myself in a fantasy. 

	[try unlocking again in 30 seconds]

Am I stunting myself by producing my day dreams
from unfinished works.

	[try unlocking again in 60 mins]

He is an unwilling participant in my head.
But the suffering is all mine. I can’t remember the last time 
I had been so caught up. To my friends it seems
  the same as the last. 

But it is nothing like before, it’s this empty line in a
final scene, the camera, the AD and the director 
  waiting
        to wrap it
                  up.

I cant stop these motions pictures in my drowsy mind.
I dont want to stop, the feeling that more could be done.
  That always more could be done.

Can I send a message, can you not leave me. 
Can I enter this day dream and lose myself in it
and not come back later emotionally whipping myself.

I am the script writer to my own demise. 
I never liked working alone.

  "we should be friends for now while we work on ourselves..."

That's the line, that’s the cliff hanger? that'll keep me, us, hooked.
Hurts, its hard to write anything worthwhile.

Please, I wish you understood. That you're all my mind can conjure 
  where nothing else would.  

I want to stay in the dream forever. 
  I shouldnt, but I am doing both.

---------------------------------

Today I read a whole article without losing focus.
I sat on my bed and folded my computer in half.
Perched it up on my knees, with the queer ramblings ready.

I giggled, because it felt like having a large 
picture book and as if I were a kid.

Then I looked around for some recognition
  or some respondent laughter.

Often then not reading, for me in particular
reading has been done in the company of loved ones.

So I imagined what he would be like if he were sat in
  the opposite corner of my room.

I think he would watch me read and giggle to myself.
While he practiced his guitar or twiddle his thumbs.
  Maybe expect me to make a smooth romantic gesture.

Before I passed on to the next article,
I looked up once more to the vacant chair in my room.
I whispered to my self "I miss him,
  and I wonder what he's doing."

I don't often read at all,
  but I did it today. All by myself.

The time 00:05, she ran her hands through my hair and said 
"I feel your gratitude all the time, you need to stop 
worrying about other people feeling appreciated."

I can see the Libra full moon from where I rest my head.
 And I glanced back.

She continued "We all feel your gratitude. I don’t think 
there is a moment that passes when I'm with you that I
think you act ungrateful. I think it's time you were more selfish. 
 Do you get what I mean?". 

"I understand, but-" champagne makes it hard for me to focus. 
Keeping the rebuttal in,
 because my friend was right. 

I spent so much time winding up the cranks in my head, about 
if I was being healthy, forcing myself through the hurt, 
 asking "where is my gratitude."

The time was 00:12, and she kept running her hands through my hair.
I was silent, I was still grateful, I felt appreciated. 

I allowed myself to feel, for the first time in a while,

 gratitude in return.`
